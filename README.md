# Portfolio

To start with I am featuring just one basic CRUD application to show my full stack coding capabilities. 
- The console app and front end were done with a pairing partner, and we tried to make it fun. 
- The back end and middle tiers that you can see on the later iterations were programmed solo.

This project also demonstrates some refactoring abilities, since it was migrated from a console app, to a JSTL/JSP app, to a Spring MVC/Ajax app. The project contains code that was commented out and replaced from the previous versions. Different iterations are included in the controller and DAO packages.

More recently I have been learning about AOP, Hibernate, and digging deeper into creating sustainable database schemas. Will upload more soon!
