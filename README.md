# Portfolio

To start with I am featuring just one basic CRUD application to show my full stack coding capabilities. 
- The console app and front end were done with a pairing partner, and we tried to make it fun. 
- The back end and middle tiers on the later iterations were programmed solo.

This project also demonstrates my refactoring capabilities, since it migrated from a console app, to a JSTL/JSP app, to a Spring MVC & Ajax app. The project contains the code from the previous versions. You can view that in the controller and DAO packages.

More recently I have been learning about AOP, Hibernate, and digging deeper into created sustainable database schemas. Will upload more soon!
